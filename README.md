Here you can find notes on different aspects of my analysis. 

Data Cleaning and Preparation, I used Python.  Here I explored the dataset and make some clean ups, ie. handling empty/null values, shorted column names, checked datatypes. I also split the dataset into two separate sets, 'enrolled' and 'prospects' to allow me to focus on segmentation. 'Enrolled students are defined as having an enroll_date.

Target Segmentation: 

Here I used Microsoft SQL Server for analysis. I've included all the SQL codes I ran. For the demographic profile, you can also find screenshots of the results. Please note I did not include all the screenshots, however if you have Microsoft SQL Server you can run the codes.
