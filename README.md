Here you can find the analysis I completed for this case study.

Data Cleaning and Preparation, I used Python.  Here I explored the dataset and make some clean ups, ie. handling empty/null values, shorted column names, checked datatypes. I also split the dataset into two separate sets, 'enrolled' and 'prospects' to allow me to focus on segmentation. 'Enrolled students are defined as having an enroll_date.
